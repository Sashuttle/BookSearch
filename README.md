# BookSearch
Challenge 21 of the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp will have me take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with RESTful API and refactor it to be a Graph QL API built with Apollo Server. This will contain MERN, React, MongoDB database, Node.js/Express.js server and API. This search engine will allow users to search for a book, save the book, and delete a book.
